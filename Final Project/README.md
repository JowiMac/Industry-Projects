# Probability Calculator

## Synopsis
This project compares dice and cards and graphs them in a chart

## Motivation
I built this code to make probability calculations faster for those who want to
compare two objects together.

## How to Run
"Probability.java" and "ProbabilityTest.java" are needed to run the latest version.
"probProj" is an old project of an earlier version of the Probability calculator.

## Code Example
'''
BarChart<String, Number> barChart = new BarChart<>(xAxis, yAxis);
'''
This is what I am most proud of in my code (line 73 in ProbabilityTest.java) because
I thought I would need to create the bar chart from scratch using Line syntax instead
of the BarChart syntax.

## Tests
Run JUnit4 to test the methods. I used multiple methods to receive an end result.
Make sure to add all necessary methods to return a positive result.

## Contributors
I had used Eclipse to run my Java code
I, John Macdonald created this code
